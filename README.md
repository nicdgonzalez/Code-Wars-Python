## How to run:

* At the start of every file is the prompt provided by Code Wars written
in the module docstring.

* At the end of every module are test cases. There is a check to make sure
tests do not run when the file is being imported so to run the provided
test cases run the file directly.

```powershell
cd ./code_wars/code_wars
python example.py
```
